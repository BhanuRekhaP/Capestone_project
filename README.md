Predictive Modelling on Lending Club Loan Status

Based on data from Lending Club, we developed a predictive model of loan status, to predict whether the loan will end up as "Good" (Fully Paid) or "Bad" (Default) status for a new customer. 

By integrating and implementing the predictive modelling on their investment shopping interface, Lending Club could easily flag loans at high risk of default and can adjust interestsâ€™ rate to offset the risk of default.

Lending Club data set contains the complete loan data for all Lending Club loans issued through year 2007-2019Q1, including the current loan status (Current, Late, Fully Paid, etc.) and the latest payment information. 

Its is unfeasible to work on this huge data on normal machines so the better approach is to take a sample and work on the sample data.

How we are Selecting Samples:

Each year 10% of the data is selected randomly using random sampling technique. The samples are tested and analysed whether they represent true population using statistical hypothesis testing. Used Z test for testing mean and proportion and Anova F test for testing variance.
